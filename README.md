### Hey, I’m Nikhil 👋🏾

I'm a recent CS + Math grad who loves building things that make sense of messy data, simplify hard problems, or just scratch a curiosity itch.

💻 I’m into:  
- AI/ML (especially NLP and interpretable models)  
- Data-driven systems and backend engineering  
- Exploring the math behind algorithms and models  

🎓 I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics from Drexel University. Along the way, I’ve worked on machine learning projects, system automation at Lockheed Martin, and cloud-based microservices at Vanguard.

🛠️ Most of my GitHub is a mix of:  
- ML implementations from scratch  
- Past projects and experiments
- Some fun (and sometimes scrappy) side explorations  

📬 Feel free to email me if you want to collaborate or just talk shop. Door's always open.
